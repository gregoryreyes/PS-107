  // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected

  // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
  // with more points_possible should be counted for more
  // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
  // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
  // "avg": number,
  // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
  // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
  // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
  // <assignment_id>: number,
  // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
  // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
